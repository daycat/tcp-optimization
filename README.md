# tcp-optimization
a script to optimize your TCP traffic \n

This script was taken from https://github.com/nkeonkeo/shs, from tools.sh. Credits to @nkeonkeo!

The only difference is that this script is now (in this repo) translated to english.
Enjoy!

## Usage

````sh
wget https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/daycat/tcp-optimization@main/tcp.sh -O tcp.sh && chmod +x tcp.sh && bash tcp.sh
````
